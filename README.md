### ShopEase eCommerce SQL Project

### Overview

This project simulates an online marketplace **ShopEase**, designed to track customers, products, orders, shipping, and reviews using a relational SQL database. It involves table creation, data insertion, and writing queries to analyze sales, customer behavior, and operations.

### Highlight: Estimating Quantity Sold Without OrderDetails

The `Orders` table includes only the `TotalAmount`, without specifying which products were bought or how many.  
To estimate sales per product, we apply the logic:

sql
Estimated Quantity = TotalAmount / Product Price

âœ… Key Queries Solved
ðŸ”¹ Basic
Retrieve customer names and emails

List products by category and price

Count electronics items

Intermediate
Total revenue from all orders

Customer with highest spending

Low stock products

High-rated reviews (4+)

joins
Orders with customer details

Reviews with product and customer names

Aggregations
Average rating per product

Revenue per product category

Country with most customers

Advanced & Subqueries

Sample Logic: Product with Highest Sales
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    P.ProductID,
    P.Name,
    SUM(O.TotalAmount) AS EstimatedTotalSales
FROM 
    Orders O
JOIN 
    Products P ON ROUND(O.TotalAmount / P.Price) = O.TotalAmount / P.Price
GROUP BY 
    P.ProductID, P.Name
ORDER BY 
    EstimatedTotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
This query estimates the sales based on price match and sums total revenue per product.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Designed under the assumption that each order involves only one product.

Real-world systems use an OrderDetails table to manage product quantities.

Ideal for learning JOIN, AGGREGATE, and SUBQUERY techniques in SQL.
